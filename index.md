## About Me
**Technical Product Manager | Engineer Turned Strategist**

I am a Technical Product Manager with over 10 years of experience bridging the gap between complex architecture and strategic business goals. My background as a software engineer allows me to "speak the language" of technical teams while driving commercial outcomes.

Most recently at **Oracle**, I led product strategy for the **Java Management Service (JMS)**, scaling the Fleet Management service to **manage 300,000+** compute instances while delivering a Download Service that secured **100,000+** automated downloads. I specialize in **'Iterative Value Delivery'**—avoiding big-bang releases in favor of launching thin, end-to-end slices to validate product-market fit early.

**Core Competencies:**
* **🚀 Strategy:** Product-Led Growth (PLG), Roadmap Strategy, B2B/B2C SaaS.
* **🛠️ Technical:** API, Cloud (OCI), Mobile Dev (Flutter/Supabase), AI/LLM Integration.
* **📊 Execution:** Agile/Scrum, RICE Prioritization, Rapid Prototyping, Telemetry Analytics.

## Featured Case Studies

### 📌 [Java Download Service - Modernizing Oracle Java Distribution](./java-download-service.html)
**Target:** Developers & DevOps | **Role:** Product Manager | **Impact:** 🚀 100k+ Downloads

**The Challenge:**
To accelerate adoption of Java Management Service, I steered the product strategy to target **Developers**, recognizing they represented a far larger user base than our traditional System Administrator persona. I evaluated high-friction areas—including **Migration** and **Performance Analysis**—but identified **Secure Oracle Java Downloads** as the most critical and fastest-to-market opportunity. The key challenge was friction: Oracle Java downloads required manual license acceptance, rendering them unusable for modern CI/CD automation.

**The Solution:**
I differentiated the product by extending standard direct downloads with **script-friendly automation**. By applying "Systems Thinking," I championed reusing 70% of our **proven delivery infrastructure** to build a lightweight **token-based license system**. This enabled secure, automated Oracle Java downloads while cutting time-to-market in half.

**The Results:**
* ✅ **100,000+** secure downloads
* ✅ **99%** of traffic is script-driven, validating the automation bet.

### 📌 [Optimizing Time-to-Value for Enterprise Fleets](./fleet-management-onboarding.html)
**Target:** System Administrators | **Role:** Product Manager | **Impact:** 📉 -70% Support Tickets

**The Challenge:**
The initial setup of Fleet Management in Java Management Service was a major churn point. Enterprise admins struggled with complex agent configuration, leading to high failure rates.

**The Solution:**
I shifted the strategy from "Documentation-Reliant" to "Self-Serve Activation." I delivered an **onboarding wizard** that automates the creation of prerequisite OCI resources, coupled with a **unified agent installer** that merges multi-step configurations into a single workflow with built-in diagnostics.

**The Results:**
* ✅ **80% reduction** in total setup time.
* ✅ **50% increase** in successful first-time connections.
* ✅ **70% drop** in installation-related support tickets.

### 📌 [Scaling via PLG: The Freemium Pivot](./jms-freemium.html)
**Target:** Java Developers | **Role:** Product Manager | **Impact:** 🚀 150% User Growth

**The Challenge:**
Adoption of the Java Management Service was stifled by a high barrier to entry. Users were hesitant to commit to paid tiers without experiencing value first, leading to stagnant activation rates.

**The Solution:**
I executed a **Product-Led Growth (PLG)** strategy by launching a **Freemium Tier**. We redesigned the user journey to offer immediate value for free, using **in-product nudges** to guide users toward advanced, paid features as their usage scaled.

**The Results:**
* ✅ **150% growth** in user base within 6 months.
* ✅ Validated the "Try before you buy" model for enterprise tools.

### 📌 [SupaNEWS: Zero-to-One Product Development](./supanews.html)
**Role:** Technical Product Manager & Full-Stack Developer | **Tech:** Flutter, Supabase, AI

**The Challenge:**
News consumption is fragmented and cluttered. I wanted to build a mobile-first experience that aggregated Australian news sources while removing clickbait and bias through AI.

**The Solution:**
I built **SupaNEWS**, a cross-platform mobile app (iOS/Android). I architected a serverless backend using **Supabase** for real-time data and integrated **Generative AI** to summarize articles and analyze sentiment.

**The Outcome:**
* 🚀 Successfully launched on the Google Play Store.
* 📱 Demonstrated full-stack mastery: Mobile (Flutter), Backend (PostgreSQL/Edge Functions), and AI Integration.

### 📌 [Monetizing Messy Data: The $1M ARR Launch](./fuzzy-matching.html)
**Role:** Technical Product Manager | **Impact:** 💰 $1M+ ARR

**The Challenge:**
Oracle Data Cloud struggled to serve the SMB market because SMB data records are notoriously messy. "Exact match" algorithms failed to link client data to our enrichment database, leaving a massive market segment unaddressed.

**The Solution:**
I led the full product lifecycle for a new **Fuzzy Matching** engine. We moved from strict determinism to **probabilistic matching**, allowing us to link and enrich imperfect data records with high confidence.

**The Results:**
* ✅ **$1M+ in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)** generated post-launch.
* ✅ **30% improvement** in data refresh cycles across partners.

## My Product Philosophy
My approach to product management is grounded in three pillars:

1.  **Iterative Value Delivery:** I avoid "Big Bang" releases. Instead, I deliver "thin slices" of end-to-end value. This allows for rapid validation using telemetry and minimizes wasted engineering effort.
2.  **Systems Thinking:** I look for leverage. In the Java Download Service project, I realized we didn't need to build a new delivery engine—we just needed a new *compliance layer* (tokens) on top of the existing one. This saved months of work.
3.  **Data-Backed Prioritization:** I use frameworks like **RICE** (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) to make transparent trade-offs. I believe in quantifying "Cost of Delay" to align stakeholders on urgent vs. important tasks.
