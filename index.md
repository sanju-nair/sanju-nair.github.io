## About Me
**Technical Product Manager | Engineer Turned Strategist**

I am a Technical Product Manager with over 10 years of experience bridging the gap between complex architecture and strategic business goals. My background as a software engineer allows me to "speak the language" of technical teams while driving commercial outcomes.

Most recently at **Oracle**, I led product strategy for the **Java Management Service (JMS)**, scaling the Fleet Management service to **manage 300,000+** compute instances while delivering a Download Service that secured **100,000+** automated downloads. I specialize in **'Iterative Value Delivery'**—avoiding big-bang releases in favor of launching thin, end-to-end slices to validate product-market fit early.

**Core Competencies:**
* **🚀 Strategy:** Product-Led Growth (PLG), Roadmap Strategy, B2B/B2C SaaS.
* **🛠️ Technical:** API, Cloud (OCI), Mobile Dev (Flutter/Supabase), AI/LLM Integration.
* **📊 Execution:** Agile/Scrum, RICE Prioritization, Rapid Prototyping, Telemetry Analytics.

## Featured Case Studies

### 📌 [Java Download Service - Modernizing Oracle Java Distribution](./java-download-service.html)
**Target:** Developers & DevOps | **Role:** Product Manager | **Impact:** 🚀 100k+ Downloads

**The Challenge:**
To accelerate adoption of Java Management Service, I steered the product strategy to target **Developers**, recognizing they represented a far larger user base than our traditional System Administrator persona. I evaluated high-friction areas—including **Migration** and **Performance Analysis**—but identified **Secure Oracle Java Downloads** as the most critical and fastest-to-market opportunity. The key challenge was friction: Oracle Java downloads required manual license acceptance, rendering them unusable for modern CI/CD automation.

**The Solution:**
I differentiated the product by extending standard direct downloads with **script-friendly automation**. By applying "Systems Thinking," I championed reusing 70% of our **proven delivery infrastructure** to build a lightweight **token-based license system**. This enabled secure, automated Oracle Java downloads while cutting time-to-market in half.

**The Results:**
* ✅ **100,000+** secure downloads
* ✅ **99%** of traffic is script-driven, validating the automation bet.

### 📌 [Optimizing Time-to-Value for Enterprise Fleets](./fleet-management-onboarding.html)
**Target:** System Administrators | **Role:** Product Manager | **Impact:** 📉 -70% Support Tickets

**The Challenge:**
The initial setup of Fleet Management in Java Management Service was a major churn point. Enterprise admins struggled with complex agent configuration, leading to high failure rates.

**The Solution:**
I shifted the strategy from "Documentation-Reliant" to "Self-Serve Activation." I delivered an **onboarding wizard** that automates the creation of prerequisite OCI resources, coupled with a **unified agent installer** that merges multi-step configurations into a single workflow with built-in diagnostics.

**The Results:**
* ✅ **80% reduction** in total setup time.
* ✅ **50% increase** in successful first-time connections.
* ✅ **70% drop** in installation-related support tickets.

### 📌 [Scaling via PLG: The Freemium Pivot](./jms-freemium.html)
**Target:** Java Developers | **Role:** Product Manager | **Impact:** 🚀 150% User Growth

**The Challenge:**
Initially, JMS Fleet Management was exclusive to **Java SE Subscription** customers. This "Paywall-First" model stifled adoption, as potential users couldn't test the utility without a commercial contract.

**The Solution:**
I executed a **Product-Led Growth (PLG)** pivot by unbundling the feature set. We made **basic monitoring free for all users** to drive bottom-up adoption, while gating **advanced capabilities** behind the subscription, using in-product nudges to convert free users to paid.

**The Results:**
* ✅ **150% growth** in user base within 6 months.
* ✅ Validated the "Try before you buy" model for enterprise tools.

### 📌 [SupaNEWS: Zero-to-One Product Development](./supanews.html)
**Role:** Founder & Technical Product Manager | **Tech:** Flutter, Supabase, AI-Assisted Engineering

**The Challenge:**
Australian news consumption is fragmented across dozens of publisher apps, most of which are plagued by intrusive ads. I wanted to build a single, unified interface for breaking news.

**The Solution:**
I built **SupaNEWS**, a cross-platform mobile app that aggregates RSS feeds from top Australian providers. I architected a **serverless backend** using Supabase and leveraged **AI-Assisted Coding** (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini) to accelerate the development lifecycle from concept to production.

**The Outcome:**
* 🚀 Successfully launched on the Google Play Store.
* ⚡ **Rapid Prototyping:** Used LLMs as "pair programmers" to build a production-grade app in a fraction of the standard development time.

### 📌 [Monetizing Messy Data: The $1M ARR Launch](./fuzzy-matching.html)
**Role:** Senior PM @ Oracle Data Cloud | **Impact:** 💰 $1M+ ARR

**The Challenge:**
The existing matching engine relied on **company domains**, which worked for large enterprises but failed for SMBs that often lacked websites. We had to rely on **company names**, but as a data aggregator, we faced inconsistent naming conventions that broke exact-match logic.

**The Solution:**
I led the pivot to a **Probabilistic Matching Engine**. I evaluated algorithms (Levenshtein Distance vs. Cosine Similarity) to optimize for name variations and designed **wireframes for a new UI workflow**, ensuring the engineering implementation aligned with the user need for confidence-based review.

**The Results:**
* ✅ **$1M+ in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)** generated post-launch.
* ✅ **Unlocked the SMB market** segment for the sales team.

## My Product Philosophy
My approach to product management is grounded in three pillars:

1.  **Iterative Value Delivery:** I avoid "Big Bang" releases. Instead, I deliver "thin slices" of end-to-end value. This allows for rapid validation using telemetry and minimizes wasted engineering effort.
2.  **Systems Thinking:** I look for leverage. In the Java Download Service project, I realized we didn't need to build a new delivery engine—we just needed a new *compliance layer* (tokens) on top of the existing one. This saved months of work.
3.  **Data-Backed Prioritization:** I use frameworks like **RICE** (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) to make transparent trade-offs. I believe in quantifying "Cost of Delay" to align stakeholders on urgent vs. important tasks.
