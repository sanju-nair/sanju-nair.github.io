## About Me
**Technical Product Manager | Engineer Turned Strategist**

I am a Technical Product Manager with over 10 years of experience bridging the gap between complex architecture and strategic business goals. My background as a software engineer allows me to "speak the language" of technical teams while driving commercial outcomes.

Most recently at **Oracle**, I led product strategy for the **Java Management Service (JMS)**, scaling the Fleet Management service to **manage 300,000+** compute instances while delivering a Download Service that secured **100,000+** automated downloads. I specialize in **'Iterative Value Delivery'**—avoiding big-bang releases in favor of launching thin, end-to-end slices to validate product-market fit early.

**Core Competencies:**
* **🚀 Strategy:** Product-Led Growth (PLG), Roadmap Strategy, B2B/B2C SaaS.
* **🛠️ Technical:** API, Cloud (OCI), Mobile Dev (Flutter/Supabase), AI/LLM Integration.
* **📊 Execution:** Agile/Scrum, RICE Prioritization, Rapid Prototyping, Telemetry Analytics.

## Featured Case Studies

### 📌 [Java Download Service - Modernizing Oracle Java Distribution](./java-download-service.html)
**Target:** Developers & DevOps | **Role:** Principal PM | **Impact:** 🚀 100k+ Downloads

**The Challenge:**
To accelerate adoption, I steered the product strategy to target **Developers**, recognizing they represented a far larger user base than our traditional System Administrator persona. I evaluated high-friction areas—including **Migration** and **Performance Analysis**—but identified **Secure Oracle Java Downloads** as the most critical and fastest-to-market opportunity. The key challenge was friction: Oracle Java downloads required manual license acceptance, rendering them unusable for modern CI/CD automation.

**The Solution:**
I differentiated the product by extending standard direct downloads with **script-friendly automation**. By applying "Systems Thinking," I championed reusing 70% of our **proven delivery infrastructure** to build a lightweight **token-based license system**. This enabled secure, automated Oracle Java downloads while cutting time-to-market in half.

**The Results:**
* ✅ **100,000+** secure downloads
* ✅ **99%** of traffic is script-driven, validating the automation bet.

### 📌 [Optimizing Time-to-Value for Enterprise Fleets](./fleet-management-onboarding.html)
**Target:** System Admins (Ops) | **Role:** Principal PM | **Impact:** 📉 -70% Support Tickets

**The Challenge:**
The Java Management Service (JMS) manages massive estates (300k+ instances), but the initial setup was a major churn point. Enterprise admins struggled with complex agent configuration, leading to high failure rates and a flood of support tickets. We needed to reduce "Time-to-First-Value" to unlock adoption.

**The Solution:**
I shifted the strategy from "Documentation-Reliant" to "Self-Serve Activation." I led the development of a **smart agent installer** with pre-packaged dependencies and built-in diagnostics, coupled with a redesigned **guided onboarding flow**. This proactively caught errors before they reached Support.

**The Results:**
* ✅ **80% reduction** in total setup time.
* ✅ **50% increase** in successful first-time connections.
* ✅ **70% drop** in installation-related support tickets.

### 📌 Project 3: $1M ARR from Scratch (Zero-to-One)
**Role:** Senior Product Manager @ Oracle Data Cloud
**The Challenge:**
The SMB market was underserved by our enterprise data solutions. We identified an opportunity to monetize a data enrichment product specifically for small-to-mid-sized businesses who needed cleaner data for their CRMs.

**The Solution:**
* **Product:** I led the development of a **fuzzy matching solution** that allowed SMBs to enrich sales leads with firmographic data on a self-serve basis.
* **Technical Implementation:** I evaluated algorithms (Cosine Similarity vs. Levenshtein’s Distance) to define the matching logic that would balance accuracy with processing cost.
* **Operations:** Streamlined data refresh cycles across 8 partners, achieving a 30% faster refresh rate.

**The Impact:**
* 💰 Generated **$1M+ in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)** in the first year.
* 📊 Validated the self-serve model for data products, opening a new revenue stream for the division.

### 📌 Project 4: SupaNEWS (Indie Mobile Product)
**Role:** Founder & Technical PM (Independent Project)
**The Context:**
To maintain my technical edge and explore the mobile ecosystem, I architected and built a cross-platform news aggregation app, currently released for Australia with plans for India and USA expansion.

**The Stack & Strategy:**
* **Tech Stack:** Built with **Flutter** (Front-end) and **Supabase** (PostgreSQL & Edge Functions) for a scalable, serverless backend.
* **AI Integration:** Leveraged LLMs (Claude, Gemini) to accelerate the SDLC by 3x, functioning as a "one-person engineering team".
* **Features:** Implemented "Reader Mode," real-time social sharing, and robust RSS ingestion pipelines.

**The Outcome:**
* 📱 Successfully launched on **Google Play Store** (Package: `com.sanjunair.supanewsau`).
* 🔄 Managed end-to-end App Store Optimization (ASO) and internal testing tracks.

## My Product Philosophy
My approach to product management is grounded in three pillars:

1.  **Iterative Value Delivery:** I avoid "Big Bang" releases. Instead, I deliver "thin slices" of end-to-end value. This allows for rapid validation using telemetry and minimizes wasted engineering effort.
2.  **Systems Thinking:** I look for leverage. In the Java Download Service project, I realized we didn't need to build a new delivery engine—we just needed a new *compliance layer* (tokens) on top of the existing one. This saved months of work.
3.  **Data-Backed Prioritization:** I use frameworks like **RICE** (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) to make transparent trade-offs. I believe in quantifying "Cost of Delay" to align stakeholders on urgent vs. important tasks.
